# Node.js Mini Projects

A collection of mini projects built with vanilla Node.js - no frameworks, just built-in modules. 

These projects focus on understanding core Node.js fundamentals before moving to frameworks like Express.

## Projects

1. Basic HTTP Server
2. File-Based Blog CLI
3. Notes App (JSON-Based CLI)
4. Todo App (JSON-Based CLI)
5. Simple Logger Tool
6. Mini Static Server
7. Environment-Aware Config Loader
8. CRUD JSON API using Pure HTTP

---

## Learning Goals

These projects explore core Node.js concepts:

1. HTTP server creation
2. File system operations
3. Environment Configuration
4. Request/response handling
5. Error handling patterns
6. Asynchronous programming

---

## Configuration

Includes environment-aware configuration to some projects for practice with:

- `.env` file handling
- Environment variables  
- Configuration patterns used in larger Node.js applications

*While this simple API could work with hardcoded values, the config setup demonstrates patterns essential for production applications.*

## Repository Update

Some projects may be moved to dedicated repositories for better organization

- "CRUD JSON API using Pure HTTP"

Note: Updates and improvements are made to projects after completion as I continue learning and applying best practices.
